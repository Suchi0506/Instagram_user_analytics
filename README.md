# TRAINITY PROJECT 2: DATA ANALYTICS PROCESS #
# TOPIC: Instagram User Analytics Using MySQL Workbench #
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION: ##
As a data analyst working closely with the product team at Instagram, my primary responsibility is to explore and analyze user behaviors and engagement on the Instagram app. These analyses are vital for formulating data-driven decisions that further the growth and success of the platform. Utilizing SQL and MySQL Workbench as my tools, I strive to uncover valuable insights from Instagram user data, which empowers numerous teams across the business.
This project aims to examine user engagement on Instagram and offer valuable insights that can aid the product team in refining the platform. By thoroughly analyzing user interactions, including likes, comments, follows, and posts, we can gain a deeper comprehension of user behaviors and
preferences. This knowledge can be leveraged by various teams, encompassing marketing, product development, and customer support, to optimize the user experience and impel business growth.

# APPROACH: #
Create a Database: The database file was provided in the attachments.

### Perform Analysis: ###
I utilised MySQL Workbench to perform the analysis and answer the questions mentioned in the project description. I used SQL queries to extract the required
information from the database, ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of the queries.

# TECH- STACK USED: #
The software I am using to do the analysis is MySQL Workbench, Version: 8.0.34 (MySQL Community Server â€“ GPL). I used this software for the project as it is easy to use and freely available.
